# Combo-Lock
_Assignment_

This Java Class Simulates a simple Combo Lock that we use in our daily life to lock our lockers in gyms or at school. The way it works is that first the user enters 3 integers to close the lock , and then they can open the lock using the left and right turn options given by the menu. keep in mind EVERY combo lock, first is reset to zero, then needs to be rotated left, then right and then another left.
